# in this tool i used httpx to make the api call (HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs,
# and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2)
The goal was extracting all the product information for busness analysis such as product name, description, images, and extra information 
I also used bs4 as html parser to parse the information and saved to csv https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/
I was able to scrape more than 500 line of product information
